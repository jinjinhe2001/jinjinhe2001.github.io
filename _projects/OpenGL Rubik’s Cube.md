Utilized the C++ OpenGL API to achieve the rotation of each layer of the Rubik’s Cube, including one-click disruption and restoration, camera movement, etc.

## Operations
- 1-9 keys to select the number of operable layers
- Q/E for left/right rotation
- R to restore with one key
- T one key to disrupting (will disrupt 25 steps)
