I Completed a parkour game for the openEuler community, made in the Cocos game engine with  Typescript. This was a team project, and I was the only programmer.  
[Github](https://github.com/jinjinhe2001/Parkour-Game)
## Gameplay
- use your fingers to swipe left and right on the screen to control Euler and avoid obstacles. Swipe up to jump, and swipe down to slide.
- Props: There are different props along the way that have different effects when Euler picks them up, such as: temporary invincibility, attracting coins, and increasing speed.
- quiz: After the character dies, a question and answer box will pop up with trivia about the OpenEuler system. Answer it and continue!
- more games: I completed the prototype of another puzzle game for the OpenEuler community and this is the next game after parkour.
