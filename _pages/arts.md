<h1 class="page__title">Paintings</h1>
<p>
    I learnt about painting during the summer vacation after my high school graduation. Basically I studied about perspective, practised how to draw by auxiliary line, and designed pixel art by myself. What's more, I taught myself how to use Blender  and created some designs with it.

    .paintingsImgWrap{
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: space-around;
    }
    .paintingsImgWrap img {
        max-width: 350px;
        height: fit-content;
        min-width: 64px;
    }
