<h1 class="page__title">Paintings</h1>
<p>
    I tried to learn painting during my high school graduation summer, but unfortunately, after that, my busy schedule with computer science studies prevented me from making much progress and my paintings are still at a "kids" level. But that's okay, I think I'll continue my interests after this busy application and exchange study season :) .
