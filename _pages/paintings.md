<h1 class="page__title">Paintings</h1>
<p>
    I learnt about painting during the summer vacation after my high school graduation. Basically I studied about perspective, practised how to draw by auxiliary line, and designed pixel art by myself through this precious course, which not only built up a fundamental cognition but also stimulated my great passion toward graphics investigation.
