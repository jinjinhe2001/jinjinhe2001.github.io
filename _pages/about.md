Hi! I am currently a Master student at Dartmouth College, majoring in Computer Science with concentration in Digital Arts, advised by Professor Bo Zhu in Visual Computing Lab.

Before coming to Dartmouth, I received my Bachelor from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. And I spent a wonderful year at University of California, Santa Barbara for exchange study.
